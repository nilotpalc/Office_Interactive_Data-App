   - Identify the product name, which usually follows the brand name
   - Consider different text formats and potential variations

2. Parse the text using these rules:
   - Brand is typically the first word or a capitalized name before the product description
   - Product name is the general category or specific type of item
   - Ignore additional descriptive text after the product name

3. Create the output as a Python dictionary with two keys: ""Brand"" and ""Product"".
**Output ONLY the dictionary, nothing else. Do not include any tags, explanations, or extra text.**

4. Important guidelines:
   - Be precise in extraction
   - If unsure, default to the most prominent text

You will extract the brand and product name from a product description text. Follow these steps precisely:

1. First, analyze the input text carefully inside <thinking> tags:
   - Look for the brand name, typically at the start or in a specific location
   - Identify the product name, which usually follows the brand name
   - Consider different text formats and potential variations

2. Parse the text using these rules:
   - Brand is typically the first word or a capitalized name before the product description
   - Product name is the general category or specific type of item
   - Ignore additional descriptive text after the product name

3. Create the output as a Python dictionary with two keys: ""Brand"" and ""Product"".
**Output ONLY the dictionary, nothing else. Do not include any tags, explanations, or extra text.**

4. Important guidelines:
   - Be precise in extraction
   - If unsure, default to the most prominent text
   - Trim any extra whitespace
   - Do not include additional descriptors beyond the core brand and product name

Example process:
<example>
Input: ""RisoPhy Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, RGB 104 Keys Ultra-Slim LED Backlit USB Wired Keyboard with Blue Switch...""
<thinking>
- Brand: RisoPhy
- Product: Mechanical Gaming Keyboard
</thinking>
Output: {Brand: ""RisoPhy"", Product: ""Mechanical Gaming Keyboard""}

You will extract the brand and product name from a product description text. Follow these steps precisely:

1. First, analyze the input text carefully inside <thinking> tags:
   - Look for the brand name, typically at the start or in a specific location
   - Identify the product name, which usually follows the brand name
   - Consider different text formats and potential variations

2. Parse the text using these rules:
   - Brand is typically the first word or a capitalized name before the product description
   - Product name is the general category or specific type of item
   - Ignore additional descriptive text after the product name

3. Create the output as a Python dictionary with two keys: ""Brand"" and ""Product"".
**Output ONLY the dictionary, nothing else. Do not include any tags, explanations, or extra text.**

4. Important guidelines:
   - Be precise in extraction
   - If unsure, default to the most prominent text
   - Trim any extra whitespace
   - Do not include additional descriptors beyond the core brand and product name

Example process:
<example>
Input: ""RisoPhy Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, RGB 104 Keys Ultra-Slim LED Backlit USB Wired Keyboard with Blue Switch...""
<thinking>
- Brand: RisoPhy
- Product: Mechanical Gaming Keyboard
</thinking>
Output: {Brand: ""RisoPhy"", Product: ""Mechanical Gaming Keyboard""}
</example>

5. Generate the final output inside <result> tags:
<result>
{Brand: ""<extracted brand>"", Product: ""<extracted product name>""}
</result>

If no clear brand or product can be determined, return:
<result>
